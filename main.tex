\title{Decentralized Group Management in Dissent}
\author{Eleanor Cawthon}
\date{Spring, 2015}
\advisor{Professors Bryan Ford and Tzu-Yi Chen, advisors}
\abstract{
Among both humans and computers, decentralized approaches to group
decision-making exhibit trade-offs between decentralization and scalability.

We provide two contributions: First, we outline a general specification for
petition protocols providing instigator anonymity. Next, we sketch how this can
be applied to provide bootstrapping and group management for the Dissent
anonymity protocol.

% TODO: Make this the intro for the protocol section.
We first present an overview of existing work on collective decisionmaking under
various trust addumptions. We go on to present a protocol for egalitarian
groups to determine their leadership in a fashion that is anonymous, verifiable,
and fully decentralized.  By combining the Dissent protocol for anonymous
communication with decentralized trust\cite{p2pd}, with a simple voting protocol
utilizing linkable ring signatures\cite{lrs}, we show how a group might attain
verifiable and anonymous elections with Byzantine trust assumptions, secure
against a global passive adversary.  As a specific example, we show how this
might be used as a server selection and group management mechanism in scalable
Dissent \cite{din}, so that the scalable protocol is used most of the time, but
where the peer-to-peer consensus can always rescind the power it has delegated.
