We identify three crucial properties for a group decisionmaking protocol that
keeps power decentralized.

First, the protocol's computation must be distributed. If the adversary has
control of the network infrastructure, it can easily block access to any central
component of a protocol (such as a Tor relay \tocite or voting
registrar\todoword{use the literature terminology}). If blocking one or a small
subset of nodes in the group is sufficient to break the protocol, this again
weakens our decentralization guarantees and renders the protocol less useful. A
fault tolerant, distributed protocol, however, can easily recover from arbitrary
changes in the network topology.

Next, the protocol must be verifiable --- any particiapnt or external auditor
should be able to examine a transcript of the protocol and determine whether or
not it was performed honestly. Without this property, it would be necessary to
trust that some portion of the group acted honestly without verification ---
this constitutes centralized trust, and is therefore inadequate.

Finally, the protocol must be anonymous --- it should be computationally hard to
attribute any vote or any petition to any specific participant. This is
essential to preserve the safety of members suggesting or voting for unpopular
proposals.

We now formalize these notions:
\section{Distributed Computation}\label{Subsection:distr}
\toadd{Some questionable notion of this that we meet}
\section{Verifiability}\label{Section:verif}
A protocol is verifiable if its output can be inspected to confirm that the
protocol was carried out correctly. A simple example of this is signing a
message with the private key associated with a well-known public key: Anyone
who knows the public key can verify the validity of the signature.

Voting protocols can be evaluated in their provision of three different
kinds of verifiability \cite{kremer_election_2010}: \emph{individual}
verifiability ensures that a voter can verify their vote was included
correctly. \emph{Universal} verifiability requires that anybody can verify
the election result correctly represents the collection of ballots cast.
Finally, \emph{Eligibility} verifiability allows anybody to verify that
only eligible voters voted, and that each voter voted only once.

\section{Anonymity}
Members of any group often face reprocussions if they participate in group
governance in ways that run contrary to the interests of other members of
the group. For this reason, election protocols often incorporate some notion
of anonymity. A protocol guarantees \emph{anonymity} in some operation a
client can complete if the output of that operation is unlinkable (or, more
precisely, cryptographically very difficult to link) to the participant who
completed it\cite{ford_hiding_2014}.

We are interested in two types of anonymity: First, within an election,
each voter's confidentiality should be preserved. Second, the instigator of an
election, who may also be the author of the proposed petition, should be
anonymous.
