In transforming Dissent in Numbers\cite{wolinsky_dissent_2012} to a fully
decentralized context, some differential terminology is necessary. We define
several components of our protocol before moving on to discuss desired security
properties.

\section{Terminology}
The protocol consists of two logical layers: A Dissent in Numbers layer, where
most communication takes place, and an underlying peer-to-peer layer where
management of the Dissent configuration occurs. We refer to the entire protocol
as Dissent, and refer to the Dissent in Numbers layer as \textit{DIN}.

We refer to any single running instance of our protocol on a single machine as a
\texttt{Peer}. When a \texttt{Peer} is part of a Dissent cluster, it is a
\texttt{Member} of that cluster.

Within the DIN layer, each \texttt{Member} takes on the role of a
\texttt{Client} as described in \cite{wolinsky_dissent_2012}. In addition, a
collectively-chosen subset of these \texttt{Member}s also runs a \texttt{Server}
process (as described in \cite{wolinsky_dissent_2012}).

\todo[inline]{TODO: Probably not relevant to mention Low
Latency Dissent, but may be worth reworking this paragraph to refer to the
possibility of generalizing}
Based on membership operations, \texttt{Member}s may take on additional roles.
In Dissent in Numbers a subset of \texttt{Member}s would also be
\texttt{Server}s. In Low-Latency Dissent one \texttt{Member}s would
also be (a) \texttt{Relay}(s). These roles are subject to change with future
membership proposals.

\section{Assumptions/Non-Goals}
\todo[inline]{TODO: turn bullet points into paragraphs}
\todo[inline]{TODO: formalize in distributed systems verification terms
(initially, next, etc.)}
We present the assumptions and goals of our model in informal terms here,
before formalizing the definitions as part of proving the properties are
satisfied in Chapter~\ref{Chapter:Proofs}.
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There is an initial \texttt{Manifest} describing a Dissent-in-Numbers
    setup, known to all \texttt{Members} it describes.
  \item While the \texttt{Member} set may change according to votes, the
    \texttt{Peer} set is fixed.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{Peer} and \texttt{Member} sets are known. In Dissent in
    Numbers, clients need not know the IP addresses of any other clients.
  \item In order to use anonymous ring signatures for voting, it is necessary
    for each signature within a scope to correspond to a specific member. An
    adversary with the power to coerce \texttt{Member}s into revealing their
    private keys after the fact may prove that a particular member voted a
    particular way.\todogrunt{Need some kind of analysis of why this is still
    useful despite that}
  \item Further, intermediate vote counts are necessarily public. We prove
    generally in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:SecretProof} that we cannot do better.
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\subsection{Desired Properties}
\paragraph{Progress:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If a valid \texttt{Member} wants to propose a \texttt{Ballot}, it can
    do so within a finite number of rounds
  \item If a \texttt{Ballot} is proposed, every \texttt{Member} should have
    the opportunity to vote on it
  \item If $t$ of $n$ clients vote for a \texttt{Ballot}, that \texttt{Ballot}
    should take effect within a finite number of rounds.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Decentralization:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item No changes to the manifest occur without $t$ of the $n$ clients'
    approval of the new manifest.
  \item From any possible state, a cadre of $t$ of $n$ clients can cause the
    manifest (and corresponding configuration) to change to any other valid
    manifest.\todoword{Define state better}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Security:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Member}s who disrupt the protocol can be detected and removed,
    without deanonymizing participants\todo[color=yellow]{TODO: Cite
      \cite{corrigan-gibbs_proactively_2013}; this is solved}
  \item  Votes should be
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Anonymous --- No member can learn which member voted which way.
    \item Verifiable --- Once a vote is complete, any member can, given
      a canonical \texttt{Ballot} containing $s$ signatures, verify how many
      of the $s$ correspond to distinct, valid members' votes, and also that
      their own vote is included.
  \end{itemize}
  \item While there are at least $t$ honest \texttt{Member}s, no changes to the
    topology should occur without $t$ of the $n$ clients' approval
  \item If there are fewer than $t$ honest \texttt{Member}s, those
    \texttt{Member}s should still retain strong anonymity among the honest
    clients, even if they no longer control the topology\todogrunt{This is
    fuzzy, explain better}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Adversary Model}
We assume the adversary can
\begin{itemize}
  \item Monitor all network traffic
  \item Control some fraction of the \texttt{Peers}, which may send arbitrary
    messages to each other through secret channels and to the group through
    ordinary channels
  \item Inject traffic\todosubst{Do we? Specify this}
\end{itemize}
