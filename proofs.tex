\section{Progress}\todoword{Add transitions (as in words)}
Given a \texttt{Collective}\todogrunt{define} a \texttt{Peer} can be in any

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Vanguard}: The \texttt{Member} has a new \texttt{Manifest} it

    an already-proposed version.
\end{itemize}

Within a configuration, communication is serial.}
\section{Security}
\subsection{Privacy}
\note{What the adversary should not learn}
\subsection{Integrity}
\note{What the adversary should not break}

Accountability: $t$ of $n$ nodes can reverse any decision
Verifiability: individual and universal, not coercion resistant.
Anonymity: No one knows how anyone else voted
