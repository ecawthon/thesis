\section{Desired Properties}
  \subsection{Verifiability}\label{Subsection:verif}
  A protocol is verifiable if its output can be inspected to confirm that the
  protocol was carried out correctly. A simple example of this is signing a
  message with the private key associated with a well-known public key: Anyone
  who knows the public key can verify the validity of the signature.

  %the actual properties
  Voting protocols can be evaluated in their provision of three different
  kinds of verifiability \cite{kremer_election_2010}: \emph{individual}
  verifiability ensures that a voter can verify their vote was included
  correctly. \emph{Universal} verifiability requires that anybody can verify
  the election result correctly represents the collection of ballots cast.
  Finally, \emph{Eligibility} verifiability allows anybody to verify that
  only eligible voters voted, and that each voter voted only once.

  % Dissent \cite{verdict}
  % and the Neff shuffle \cite{neff} both use zero-knowledge
  % proofs to achieve verifiability.

  \subsection{Anonymity}\label{Subsection:anon}
  Members of any group often face reprocussions if they participate in group
  governance in ways that run contrary to the interests of other members of
  the group. For this reason, election protocols often incorporate some notion
  of anonymity. A protocol guarantees \emph{anonymity} in some operation a
  client can complete if the output of that operation is unlinkable (or, more
  precisely, cryptographically very difficult to link) to the participant who
  completed it\cite{ford_hiding_2014}.

  We are interested in two types of anonymity: First, within an election,
  each voter's confidentiality should be preserved. Second, the instigator of an
  election, who may also be the author of the proposed petition, should be
  anonymous.

  % \todosubst{discussion of trust models here?}
  % Dissent makes use of
  % pseudonyms to provide this, separating the protocol correctness and
  % accountability layer from the layer in which messages are revealed. Group
  % membership voting could conceivably take place at either.

\section{Existing Systems}
\subsection{Electronic Voting} \label{Subsection:evoting}
  \toadd{beef up this section.}
  %evoting intro
  Secure electronic voting systems have arisen largely out of a desire to
  retain secret ballots (no one should learn how a particular voter voted)
  while also guaranteeing accurate and fair counting of votes. Unlike
  distributed consensus protocols, secure electronic voting systems generally
  achieve their security properties through decentralization of trust rather
  than computation. They normally depend on a single executor of the vote
  aggregation protocol, using verifiability to ensure that each voter can be
  confident their vote was tallied fairly.

  One solution is presented in \cite{neff}, and the initial assignment of
  pseudonyms in Dissent already uses a variation on this protocol. In the Neff
  shuffle, each voter encrypts their vote in such a way that the aggregator
  must permute the vote ciphertexts before being able to decrypt them. The
  result is a permutation which no one knows --- a voter can verify that their
  ciphertext is present in the permutation, but gains no information about the
  correspondence between other ciphertexts and other voters. It is both
  individually and universally verifiable.

  The individual verifiability of \cite{neff} is based on each
  voter's retention of their secret key. \emph{Coercion-resistant} electronic
  voting protocols remain robust even if secret keys are compromised: In
  \cite{juels_coercion-resistant_2005}, the voter uses their secret key only
  to establish eligibility, at which point they are assigned a random element
  of a well known set to use in their actual ballot. The ballots are
  unlinkable to the secret keys, and there is no way for an outsider to
  confirm whether a particular random element corresponds with a particular
  voter. This protocol achieves strong resistance to multiple kinds of
  coercion by deliberately weakening the eligibility verification property to
  depend on trust in the ``registrar'' who validates credentials and assigns
  the voting keys, preventing ``forced-abstention'' attacks (in which the
  adversary demands a voter simply not participate) by making it impossible
  for outsiders to verify the set of voters.

  These protocols provide useful templates for how a distributed voting
  protocol might accomplish similar security properties.

  \subsection{Distributed Consensus}
    Distributed consensus protocols allow groups of nodes to come to an
    agreement on canonical values. For example, in a distributed database, if an
    unreliable power supply causes some portion of servers to be offline for
    each of several transactions, these protocols allow the
    servers to reconcile their records so that all servers agree on the
    transaction history. The problem was popularized by
    \cite{paxos}, which proposed the framing and solution now
    known as Paxos: A Paxos cluster that consists of 2$f+1$ nodes must have a
    \emph{quorum} of $f + 1$ participating nodes at any given time.
    Transactions occur in three phases: First, the single current designated
    leader (Proposer) proposes the $n$th change. Next, if no other participants
    (Acceptors) have received a proposal numbered higher than $n$, the Acceptors
    promise to ignore future lower numbered requests.  Finally, upon receiving
    $f+1$ Promises, the Proposer declares success to all Acceptors. This allows
    the cluster to maintain a consistent record of transactions as long as a
    quorum is present.


\subsection{Anonymity Protocols}
\label{subsection:ExistingAnonymity}
\toadd{Set this up as problems with electronic voting schemes}
  Every anonymity tool shares one basic goal: Given a set of assumptions about
  an adversary's capabilities, an anonymity tool provides a way for a user to
  broadcast a message without the adversary being able to discover the author
  of the message.  To illustrate the general approach and some common
  security assumptions, we first consider The Onion Router (Tor), the most
  widely used anonymity tool today\cite{ford_hiding_2014}

  \subsubsection{Onion Routing with Tor}
  % \label{Subsubsection:Tor}
    Tor aims to provide an anonymity service that, to the end user, behaves like
    a one-hop proxy: If Alicia wants to send an HTTP request to Badru using Tor,
    Alicia sends a request through Tor, Tor forwards the request to Badru, Badru
    replies to Tor, and Tor forwards the response to Alice. Under the surface,
    when Alicia's traffic enters the Tor network, it is encrypted and
    transmitted among several "onion routers" before reaching an "exit relay",
    which decrypts the request and passes it onto Badru. Each intermediate onion
    router only knows the next hop in the path from Alicia to Badru - no single
    node knows its traffic originated at Alicia or is en route to Badru - so no
    one in the network knows the complete path.

    Tor provides anonymity from an adversary who ``can observe some fraction of
    the network traffic; who can generate, modify, delete, or delay traffic; who
    can operate onion routers of [their] own; and who can compromise some
    fraction of the onion routers''\cite{dingledine_tor:_2004}. If an adversary
    can observe much more than a small fraction of traffic, or if the adversary
    controls many colluding nodes, other attacks become possible, and the
    anonymity guarantees no longer hold. We now know that the U.S. National
    Security Agency actively uses such attacks, and so a new protocol is
    necessary in order to remain anonymous from the N.S.A.

    \subsubsection{Strong Anonymity with Dissent}
  Dissent is an alternative to Tor that provides provable anonymity even if
  only one server in the network is honest\cite{p2pd}.
  In its present form, a Dissent cluster consists of $m$ servers and $n$
  connected clients\cite{din}. Provable anonymity is
  achieved through a modified version of the Dining Cryptographers
  problem\cite{chaum_dining_1988}: each client $i$ shares a secret $K_{ij}$
  with each server $j$. Communication proceeds in rounds, within which each
  client has a designated $k$-bit slot.  Before any messages are sent, a
  secure shuffle\cite{neff} assigns each client to a slot so
  that the owner of a slot is the only node in the system which knows who owns
  that slot.  In any client $s$'s slot, every client and every server
  generates $k$ bits of random noise seeded with each of its shared secrets
  $K_{ij}$, and combines these with an exclusive or (xor) operation to produce
  that node's ciphertext. Client $s$ also combines (via xor) a $k$-bit message
  with its noise to create its ciphertext. The combination (via xor) of all
  clients' and servers' ciphertext includes the noise stream associated with
  each shared secret twice, and so all noise cancels out and client $s$'
  message is revealed. However, since deciphering this requires the
  participation of all nodes in the system, it is impossible to tell which
  client transmitted a message in a given slot. Dissent also incorporates an
  accountability mechanism, allowing any node that disrupts the protocol to be
  detected and removed from the cluster
  \cite{verdict}.

  The original Dissent was fully peer-to-peer
  \cite{p2pd}. The shift to a client-server model
  allows for significantly improved performance, but it introduces several new
  concerns, particularly relating to misbehaving servers, a new class of DoS
  attacks, and group formation.

\section{Threat Models}
  Newly available information about vulnerabilities and global-scale
  surveillance in today's centralized internet infrastructure has brought new
  security considerations and threat models to the foreground of networked
  system research. It has rendered a swath of anonymity and voting tools
  obsolete, and poses a significant threat to those that remain. Group
  management protocols aimed at dissidents must take this into account.

  %TODO: move to non-goals?
  % \paragraph{Accountability:} In the context of Dissent, accountability refers
  % to the ability of a protocol to detect and exclude participants who disrupt
  % the protocol \cite{sec}, while proving that the disruptor did
  % indeed disrupt the protocol. Such a mechanism is necessary in peer-to-peer
  % protocols like Dining Cryptographers in which a single disruptor can make
  % the result of a round unusable. In Dissent, accountability checks occur
  % without revealing the link between any message and its sender --- moreover,
  % it is not possible to deliberately exclude a participant on the basis of
  % valid messages the participant sends. That is, the Dissent accountability
  % mechanism does not break anonymity.
  % \paragraph{Forward Progress:} A protocol that guarantees forward progress
  % given certain conditions will eventually make progress as long as those
  % conditions are met. More strict bounds on what ``eventually'' means are
  % possible. In the original Dissent, for example, forward progress can be
  % guaranteed if all clients follow the protocol and remain online, but not
  % otherwise: The accountability mechanism was so arduous that $f$ disrupting
  % clients could prevent any messages from being transmitted for $f$ hours
  % \cite{verdict}. Protocols that make use of quorums
  % rather than being fully peer-to-peer are able to provide stronger guarantees
  % of forward progress \cite{paxos}.
  \subsection{Byzantine Fault Tolerance}
    In shifting our focus from offline voting algorithms to networked protocols,
    we must consider several types of disruptions not taken into account by
    those algorithms. In particular, any member tasked with ``broadcasting'' a
    message may equivocate, sending different values to different participants.
    Existing work on distributed consensus provides various approaches to these
    problems.

    Paxos and many similar protocols makes the simplifying assumption that all
    nodes in the system are honest --- the only faults considered are those
    triggered by nodes suddenly going offline. If nodes may be malicious, they
    may ``fail'' not just by disappearing, but by forging messages in an effort
    to influence the consensus value. \emph{Byzantine} consensus protocols allow
    the honest nodes in a system to arrive at a canonical value, so long as some
    minimum portion of nodes are honest. The original Paxos can
    accommodate Byzantine failures if an additional verification stage, in which
    all Acceptors communicate with all other Acceptors in order to detect
    equivocation, is added before the final step \cite{castro_practical_1999}.
    Additional optimizations to regular and Byzantine Paxos have also been
    developed \cite{lamport_fast_2006}. If the adversary can not only send
    arbitrary messages but also monitor messages exchanged among other nodes,
    additional attacks are possible. One approach to this divides the nodes into
    small quorums in an effort to contain malicious nodes \cite{king_load_2011}
    while also providing better scalability than solutions that require
    all-to-all communication to thwart equivocators.

    In both its standard and Byzantine formulations, the distributed consensus
    problem assumes discrepancies in the record will only be due to faults ---
    that is, each assumes all honest participants either agree on what the value
    should be or agree to accept the value reported by the nodes who do know the
    value.  In the election of rotating leaders or servers, the correct value is
    not knowable a priori. If our leader election algorithm is modeled on other
    election protocols, it must be assumed that honest nodes may disagree on
    which servers they wish to elect.

  \subsection{Global Passive Adversary}
  To provide anonymity from an adversary like the N.S.A., a modern anonymity
  protocol must protect against several forms of attacks. Feigenbaum et.
  al.\cite{feigenbaum_seeking_2013} highlight several specific attacks to which
  onion routing is vulnerable:\todoword{figure out if Tor should be moved}
  \paragraph{Global traffic analysis:}
  If the adversary can monitor most of the traffic on the internet globally,
  the adversary can with high probability see the link from Alicia to the Tor
  network and from the Tor exit relay to Badru. This means the adversary can
  observe that the messages Alicia sends correspond to messages Badru receives
  some short amount of time later. Even if the messages themselves are
  encrypted, the adversary can analyze the lengths and other metadata about the
  messages to correlate this traffic.
  % TODO: Move to non-goals; possibly add self-ID
  % \paragraph{Active attacks:}
  % Global traffic analysis attacks only require the adversary to be able to
  % monitor global traffic. If the adversary can also modify or generate
  % traffic, several other attacks are possible. The adversary can launch
  % \emph{man-in-the-middle} (MITM) attacks in which it impersonates Alicia,
  % Badru, or one or more Tor nodes. The adversary can launch \emph{Sybil}
  % attacks, in which many different Tor clients controlled by the same
  % adversary join the network as individual clients. Either of these can be
  % used to create \emph{Denial-of-Service} (DoS) attacks, which might either
  % prevent users from connecting to Tor at all, or force Tor traffic to go
  % through particular, potentially adversary-controlled, Tor nodes ---
  % de-anonymizing the users.
  \paragraph{Intersection attacks:}
  In general, it is possible to tell when users are using an anonymity
  service --- the anonymity comes from the difficulty of linking any particular
  user to particular messages produced by the service. Over time, however, the
  client set of an anonymity service is unlikely to remain fixed. A passive
  adversary monitoring the outputs of an anonymity service as well as the set
  of users connected can narrow the set of users who potentially, for example,
  updated a particular blog with a static pseudonym, by excluding users  not
  online during all updates to the blog.\todoword{reword}

  \subsection{The Trouble with Relays}
  \label{Subsection:Relays}
  \todoword{copy edit Tor vs. Dissent}
    One potential approach to making Dissent widely available would be to have
    well-known, globally dispersed Dissent servers available for clients to
    connect to, similar to the current state of Tor. Any such well-known server
    list, however, is susceptible to blocking by internet service providers. It
    would therefore be preferable to have servers be short-lived, or at least
    not well known. Since Dissent takes place over regular TCP connections,
    detecting that the protocol is being executed without knowledge of the
    addresses of servers would be difficult to accomplish without a great number
    of false positives \cite{houmansadr_parrot_2013}, so this may be enough to
    realistically preclude most attempts to block access to the protocol
    entirely.  Additionally, while the current version of Dissent guarantees
    that malicious servers cannot deanonymize a client without the cooperation
    of all servers, and guarantees that disrupting servers can be exposed, it
    provides no way to remove a disrupting or malicious server form the system.

    One way to resolve these problems would be to have clusters of Dissent
    clients elect temporary servers among themselves, allowing servers to either
    step down (e.g., by going offline) or be impeached by some portion of the
    clients.  Doing so in a truly decentralized and fair fashion is a
    non-trivial problem.  We consider several other areas of research relevant
    to solving it.
